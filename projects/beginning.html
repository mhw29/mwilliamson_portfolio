            <h3 class="mb-3">Speed</h3>
            <p>In the beginning, vMOX, then known as Cellular Optimization, had the ambitious goals of being an industry leader in 
              cost reduction. The idea was solid, the method was solid, the approach was not scalable. When starting at Cellular Optimization,
              the largest customer under management was a 1,000 line valet parking company. It would take 8 hours to generate a single report that could
              be analyzed by a member of our team. We had a computer in the corner that's sole job was to process this bill.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mb-3">Accuracy</h3>
            <p>All processing was done through a third-party source.  Their product would require a manual review and audit against their output because 
              of the manual nature of their implementation. The account management team would spend hours logging every
              error found within each processed file. We would then correct these errors and begin the process of loading wireless invoices into our system.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Enter The Monster</h3>
            <p>Over the course of three months, I designed, developed, and implemented what would become known affectionetly as "The Monster". 
              This massive Excel spreadsheet linked to an existing Access database that would form the foundation that accelerated our managed service.
            </p>
            <p>After deployment, data load lag times were reduced from two weeks to two days.  Data entry errors were reduced by 99%.  Savings increased by 
              40% which grew revenue by 20%. Within five months, we terminated our agreement with our data processor, 
              freeing additional cash to support our rapid expansion.

            <h3 class="mb-3">The Monster Is Growing!</h3>
            <p>The monster met the need of the business over the next three years with minor tweaks and revisions as wireless providers
              refined their raw data feeds. 
            </p>
            <p>The Access database supporting The Monster began to show fatigue after our second Fortune 500 win.  We had to look for a new solution.
              The team has grown by three to support our newly found success.  We had to migrate our existing systems from Access to SQL Server to address database size limitations.
              Between onboarding, training, and mentoring our new team members, I also had to get this migration completed before we hit the hard limits of Access!
              I worked over the course of next month to upgrade our existing systems to leverage a SQL Server backbone without impacting
              current business operations.  
            </p>
            <p>At the end of this process, we had a fully functional, performant migration.  The team didn't miss a beat and 
              hit the grount running with the new system as we continued to enhance our managed service offering and grow our operational staff.

            <h3 class="mb-3">The Acquisition</h3>
            <p>The early months of 2012 presented a new set of challenges I had never experienced.  Cellular Optimization was acquired. 
              The acquistion was a complimentary business to an existing landline offering.  In terms of operational process, it
              was business as usual.   
            </p>
            <p>Once the acquisition was finalized, business exploded. The business was signing and onboarding a customer a week. 
              We were accustomed to closing three to four customers per year before this point.  It was a major shift for our operational staff.  It was a challenge
              for me as I had to grow our support staff and enhance/maintain the software simutaneously.

            <p>The early months of 2012 presented a new set of challenges I had never experienced.  Cellular Optimization was acquired. 
              The acquierer was a complimentary business to an existing landline offering.  In terms of operational process, it
              was business as usual.   
            </p>
            <p>Once the acquisition was finalized, business exploded. The business was signing and onboarding a customer a week. 
              We were accustomed to closing three to four customers per year before this point.  It was a major shift for our operational staff.  It was a challenge
              for me as I had to grow our support staff and enhance/maintain the software. The software, while performing well, was being 
              pushed to the absolute limit every day.
            </p>
            <p>I was tasked with managing the migration of our existing operational process and development into the primary application
              used to support the existing landline business. The process from start to finish took approximately one year. 
              During this process, I managed a team of outsourced developers to ensure existing customer expectations and billing processes
              were maintained as we migrated. 
            </p>
            <p>We encountered numerous challenges during this migration.  It was my first experience with product management. 
              We iterated, failed, and iterated some more.  The collaboration, brainstorming, and success were something I was missing from my current 
              role as Director, Operations.  This experience was the beginning of the second phase of my career, creating B2B applications to
              support a rapidly growing managed service offering.
